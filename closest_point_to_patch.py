# Description: find the closest points of a point cloud to a surface patch.
# Algorithm:
# 1. Load the surface patch and the point cloud.
# 2. Divide the patch to 32x32 smaller patches.
# 3. For each smaller patch, find the closest point in the point cloud.
# 4. Determine if the closest point is at either side of the patch.
# 5. Find the index of the closest points in the point cloud and correlate that to the index of the small patch.
